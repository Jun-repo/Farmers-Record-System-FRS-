#### Step 2: Download the Executable File
1. Obtain the "Farmers Record System.exe" file from the official source provided by the developer.
   - Recommended: Download from the GitHub releases page (see Developer Contact Information below for the repository link).
2. Save the file to a location on your computer (e.g., Desktop or Downloads folder).

#### Step 3: Run the Installer
1. Locate the downloaded "Farmers Record System.exe" file.
2. Double-click the file to start the installation process.
   - If prompted by Windows Defender or User Account Control (UAC), click "Yes" to allow the app to make changes to your device.
   - Note: If Windows flags the file as "unrecognized," click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed (this is common for new software not yet widely recognized).

#### Step 4: Follow Installation Prompts
1. The installer will launch a setup wizard.
2. Accept the default installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Farmers Record System) or choose a custom location.
3. Click "Install" to begin the installation.
4. Wait for the process to complete, then click "Finish" to close the wizard.
   - Optional: Check the box to "Launch Farmers Record System" immediately after installation.

#### Step 5: Launch the Application
